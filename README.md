## Standardized Architecture for CJIS-based Assurance Frameworks in the AWS Cloud

This Quick Start deploys and configures a standardized architecture that helps organizations with workloads that fall in scope for the 
[Criminal Justice Information Services (CJIS) Security Policy version 5.6](https://www.fbi.gov/file-repository/cjis-security-policy-v5_6_20170605.pdf). 

These requirements typically apply to systems that must go through a formal assessment and authorization process to ensure sufficient protection of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information and information systems, based on the security category and impact level of the system (low, moderate, or high), and a risk determination.

The deployment is automated by customizable AWS CloudFormation templates and scripts that build and configure the environment in about 30 minutes. 
You can also use the AWS CloudFormation templates as a starting point for your own implementation.

For architectural details, step-by-step instructions, and customization options, see the [deployment guide](https://s3.amazonaws.com/quickstart-reference/enterprise-accelerator/cjis/latest/doc/standard-cjis-architecture-on-the-aws-cloud.pdf).

The Quick Start also includes a [security controls matrix (Microsoft Excel spreadsheet)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/quickstart-reference/enterprise-accelerator/cjis/latest/assets/CJISD-ITS-DOC-08140-5.6-Controls-Mapping.xlsx), which shows how the Quick Start components and configuration map to CJIS requirements.
